# DDD Aggregates Example

This is example of modelling DDD aggregates. \
It's based on source code from [Patterns, Principles and Practices of Domain-Driven Design by Scott Millett & Nick Tune](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Principles-Practices-Domain-Driven-Design/dp/1118714709).

This is amazing book about DDD and I recommend it all of you!
