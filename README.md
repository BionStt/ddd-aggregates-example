# DDD Aggregates Example

This repository contains code that accompanies presentation ASC LAB team gave at meetup about “Creating better code with Domain Driven Design”.

This is example of modelling DDD aggregates. \
It's based on source code from [Patterns, Principles and Practices of Domain-Driven Design by Scott Millett & Nick Tune](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Principles-Practices-Domain-Driven-Design/dp/1118714709).

This is amazing book about DDD and I recommend it all of you!
